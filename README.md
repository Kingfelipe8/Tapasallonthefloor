# Tapasallonthefloor
Aiming to learn a bit by making a stupid game on the pi using the display hat mini (https://github.com/pimoroni/displayhatmini-python)

The initial idea was based on a friends mishearing of song lyrics, with the aim being a simple matching game, base don pictures of tapas dishes. the initial version is a simple colour match with some scoring and end states.
